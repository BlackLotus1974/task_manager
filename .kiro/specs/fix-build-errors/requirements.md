# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The task management application is currently experiencing build failures due to ESLint errors that prevent successful deployment. These errors include unused variables, unused imports, and TypeScript strict mode violations. This feature addresses these build issues to ensure successful deployment and maintain code quality standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to build successfully without ESLint errors, so that deployments can proceed without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL complete without ESLint errors
2. WHEN unused variables are detected THEN the system SHALL either remove them or mark them as intentionally unused
3. WHEN unused imports are detected THEN the system SHALL remove them from the codebase
4. WHEN TypeScript strict mode violations occur THEN the system SHALL resolve them with proper typing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper TypeScript typing throughout the codebase, so that type safety is maintained and development experience is improved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN explicit `any` types are used THEN the system SHALL replace them with proper type definitions
2. WHEN variables are declared with `let` but never reassigned THEN the system SHALL use `const` instead
3. WHEN type guards are imported but unused THEN the system SHALL remove the unused imports

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean code without unused imports and variables, so that the codebase remains maintainable and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components import utilities they don't use THEN the system SHALL remove those imports
2. WHEN function parameters are defined but unused THEN the system SHALL either use them or mark them as intentionally unused
3. WHEN variables are defined but never used THEN the system SHALL remove them or refactor the code to use them

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build process to be reliable and consistent, so that continuous integration and deployment workflows function properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build runs in production THEN the system SHALL complete successfully
2. WHEN ESLint rules are violated THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
3. WHEN code quality issues are detected THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment until resolved
